            <p>This near-infrared lamp has two different LEDs: 660nm (red) and 850nm (near-infrared). These wavelengths are the most studied in the literature for their physiological effects.

                Mechanism Of Action

                The physiological effects are based on a phenomenon calledphotobiomodulation, which means utilizing non-ionizing photonic energy to trigger photochemical changes in cellular structures that are receptive to photons, particularly in the mitochondria. At the cellular level, the mitochondria absorb the visible red and near-infrared energy that produce energy (ATP) in the cells through cytochrome C oxidase. The product comes with ceiling hangers, power cord and dual light switches that will help you achieve 660nm and 850nm LEDs on top separately.

                Wavelengths - 660nm and 850nm
                Size: 48cm x 22.5cm x 7.5cm
                EU plug
                Input voltage: 100-240V (works both U.S. and EU)
                Light output of each lamp: 200mW / cm2 at 5 cm distance – 40mW / cm2 at 45 cm distance
                Weight: 4.0 kg
                Warranty:

                1 year limited warranty

                INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF RED LIGHT AND NEAR-INFRARED LIGHT (PHOTOBIOMODULATION):

                After the invention of the light bulb in the late 19th century, it was possible to provide light locally to different parts of the body. The invention of laser light in the 1960s made it possible to centralize single-wavelength light and use it, for example, in laser acupuncture therapy (soft laser). The new LED light technology has made it possible to replace the soft laser with the most economical LEDs with sufficient luminous efficacy that can narrow the wavelength of light precisely enough. The visible red light has a wavelength of 620–700 nm, followed by an invisible near-infrared light in the wavelength spectrum between 700 nm and 1400 nm (99 % of the near-infrared light is invisible to the eye).

                One of the most important mechanisms of action of red light is its activating effect on cellular energy production, which is not due to the thermal effect of the lamps, but because the cells' energy powerhouses, the mitochondria, are capable to absorb red light at wavelengths of 600-1000nm. The visible red light-emitting LEDs are best suited for superficial use, while low visibility infrared (IR) emitting bulbs are capable of affecting several centimeters deep in tissue.

                Use Of Near-Infrared And Red Light Bulbs

                Do not touch the skin with the device. Use at minimum 5-10 cm from the skin. The distance can be increased if it feels better (ideally 40-50 cm). If you want to reach deeper into the tissues, you can hold the lamp at a distance of 5–10 cm from the skin. It is a good idea to use the lamp in the morning or afternoon. When used in the evening, it can stimulate and interfere with sleep (although there are also studies where a short 5 min light therapy session on the body can improve sleep quality).

                Getting Started

                During the first week use 2 minutes daily. If the device is used for two separate targets (for example to hand and to foot), the operating time is 1.5 minutes each. If needed, the operating time can be increased to 3–5 minutes in the next week and longer if needed per target area. Use time of more than 15 minutes is not recommended because red light has a narrow therapeutic window – in other words, longer use time does not increase the effect, but may even reverse it. People react differently to light, so everyone should test the correct distance from the skin and the duration of use.

                After initial testing, the device can be used 1-2 times a day, sometimes as little as 2-3 times per week is enough. If you want to reach deeper into the subcutaneous tissue, you can apply it a little longer and at a shorter distance to the skin (5-10 cm).

                Possible Side Effects Of Use

                A rare side effect of use may be the autonomic nervous system overactivity, restlessness, and insomnia, especially if in the beginning you are using it at too high a dose (too close to the skin or for a too long time).

                NOTE!
                Do not apply the lamp directly to the eyes for extended periods of time. Wipe the lamp lens periodically with a soft cloth. The lamp should not be used in damp areas such as the sauna and bathroom.

                REMEMBER TO TURN OFF THE LAMP BY TAKING THE PLUG FROM THE WALL AFTER USING.</p>
